## RISK-ADJUSTED PROJECTIONS

### Probability-Weighted Revenue (Year 2)

| Scenario | Probability | Revenue | Weighted |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| Bear (-30%) | 15% | £1,369K | £205K |
| Conservative (-15%) | 25% | £1,662K | £416K |

| Bull (+30%) | 5% | £2,542K | £127K |
| **Expected Value** | 100% | - | **£1,867K** |

### Downside Protection

**Minimum Viable Business** (if growth slower than projected):
- 200 units/year = £800K revenue
- 65% gross margin = £520K gross profit
- Lean team (3 FTE) = £180K personnel
- Total OpEx = £300K
- **Break-even at 200 units** (vs. 450 projected)

**Pivot Options** if hardware sales lag:
1. Software-only licensing (lower margin, faster adoption)
2. White-label OEM partnerships (volume, lower branding)
3. Enterprise services focus (consulting, fine-tuning)
